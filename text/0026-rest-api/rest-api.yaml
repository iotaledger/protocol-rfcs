      summary: Returns the health of the node.
      description: >-
        Returns the health of the node. A node considers itself healthy if its solid
        milestone is at most two delta away from the latest known milestone, has at
        least one ongoing gossip stream and the latest known milestone is newer
        than 5 minutes. This information might be useful for load-balancing
        or uptime monitoring.

        Returns two tips. If the node can only serve a single tip,
        `tip1MessageId` and `tip2MessageId` are identical. The tips can be considered as `non-lazy` and are therefore ideal for attaching a message.

        Submit a message. The node takes care of missing* fields and tries to
        build the message. On success, the message will be stored in the Tangle.
        This endpoint will return the identifier of the built message. *The
        node will try to auto-fill the following fields in case they are
        missing: `networkId`, `parent1MessageId`, `parent2MessageId`, `nonce`.
